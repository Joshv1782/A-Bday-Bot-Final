Keeping track of everyone's birthday is hard, why not have a A-Bday-Bot take care of that for you!?

This Discord bot is designed to let members of your server enter their birthdays and have them stored.
The bot will send a message to the user on their special day whishing them a Happy Bday!


Install and setup:
To install the bot, please go to our webpage and click Invite. You will then be directed to login into discord.

Once you have logged in, you will then be able to choose which server you wish to invite it to.

Once it has been invited into your guild, invite the bot to any channel (or create a specific channel for the bot if you want),
and give it all " TEXT PERMISSIONS" **EXCLUDING "Manage Messages". 

Once your permissions are set, type: !bb hi  into the channel chat, and be pleasantly greeted!


Commands:
Please find the commands listed on our web page.

Not Completed:

Database not complete:
I tried for 7 straight hours to understand databases more and I just don't seem to understand the concept very well.
I thought I had a good handle on the topic from class, but when it came time to implement what I had learned, I just drew a blank.

I know that this will most likley not satisfy the requirements, but I did have the bot log to "anathema.json" and have it store the information.

I did eventually find a video that would have walked me through setting up MySQL and creating tables for the bot to store in.
If I would have had more time or if extensions were granted, I am confident I would have been able to complete this part of the project successfully.

Bot not complete:
I was unable to write a "!bb my bday" message and return as I was not able to figure out the database.
I wanted the Bot to return: @user, Your birthday is *the date they had entered into the bot*.
It would have been my final else if on what would have been line 91 in my index,js file.
It would have also been added in my commands.html page by adding another <tr><td></td></tr>
